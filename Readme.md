# Quake2 with DirectX 12 renderer

- Yet another attempt to rewrite Quake 2 renderer to work on DirectX 12.

- I use VS2017, but it should work for VS2019 as well.

- This repo doesn't contain any assets so you still need original game to run it.

- I do this project for fun, so no guarantees is given.

How to run:
  1) Open quake2.sln
  2) Open Property Manager
  3) In Property Manager go quake2 -> Debug | Win32 -> Quake 2
  4) Click on User Macros
  5) Change GameDir to point on the root directory of the original game
